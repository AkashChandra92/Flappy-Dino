### Flappy-Dino

The game works like the original flappy bird but with a twist. We have a flapping pterodactyl. The aim of the game is to go as
far as possible and beat the high score.

#### Setup

- The game runs by simply clicking on the index.html file and running it in the browser.
- The custom sprite is located in the image folder.
- There are some sample audio files in the audio folder.

Enjoy!
